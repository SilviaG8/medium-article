        <h3>Love to travel but also love taking care of the planet?</h3>
          <p>There's no doubt that the clima change emergency has brought the topic of sustainable travels to the forefront of everyone's mind, and it's vital for each of us to look at how we can be more conscious about it.</p>
          <p>While some believe that there is no such thing as sustanable travel and that all leisure travel is damaging to the planet, I prefer to see the possibilities rather than the pessimistic. It is unrealistic to think that
          the whole world will stop travelling - even if Covid-19 stopped it for the moment - forever. So rather than focusing on the negatives, let us think about a more eco-friendly way of travel. Let us look what sustaniable travel means,
          highlighting the ways why it's important, and discovering the ways in which all of us can be more sustainable before, during and after our trips abroad.</p>
          <p>It is definitely possible to change the way you go about planning your travel experiences to ensure you have the least impact possible on the planet.
          All it takes is arming yourself with some knowledge and research about sustainability and eco travel best practise, and trying your hardest to implement this whenever possible. But what does it really mean when we say 'Sustaniable travel'?</p>

          <div class="Info">
            <p class="wto">Sustainable travel has been defined by the World Tourism Organization as:</p>
             <p class="wto-text">"Tourism that takes full account of its current and future economic,
              social and environmental impacts, addressing the needs of visitors,
              the industry, the environment and host communities."</p>
          </div>

            <p>That means that we should put local culture, natural resources and the enviroment first, rather than focusing on simply creating wealth for large corporations. In short, it means discovering a way in which we, as travellers, can explore the world longterm without having a negative impact on it.</p>

              <h3>Some tips and ideas for a more sustainable way to travel</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>MAKE THE MOST OF YOUR LOCAL SURROUNDINGS</li>
                  <p>The easiest way to reduce your carbon footprint while travelling is to not travel far. We are lucky to have so many amazing places to visit in Europe.</p>
                <li>CHOOSE TRAVELLING BY TRAIN, BUS OR SHIP OVER FLYING</li>
                  <p>If you have the time to travel slow, take the bus, train or ship. They have generally a less negativ impact than flying. And it may
                  actually lead to a more unique and fun experience too!</p>
                <li>LOOK FOR MORE SUSTAINABLE HOTELS</li>
                  <p>Take the time to find a hotel or hostel how are more environmentally conscious. This could mean solar power, rainwater harvesting, energy-efficient lightning and so on.</p>
                <li>GO CAMPING OR GLAMPING</li>
                  <p>Choosing to camp or glamp is not only better for the enviroment but also you will save money, and get a more authentic experience!</p>
